# 🥁 AI-Based Virtual Drumset 🎵

A real-time virtual drumset built using Python and OpenCV that allows you to play drums using colored objects (like sticks or markers) tracked by your webcam. When a colored object enters predefined zones on the screen, the system triggers keyboard events to simulate drum hits.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Color-based object tracking** using HSV masking.
- 🎥 **Live webcam feed** processing with OpenCV.
- ⌨️ **Keyboard simulation** using PyAutoGUI to trigger drum sounds.
- 📏 **Interactive hit zones** detected using contour analysis.
- ⚡ **Real-time response** with optimized video frame handling.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Capture webcam video using OpenCV.
2. Convert frames to **HSV color space** to isolate specific colors (e.g., red or blue).
3. Track motion of colored objects (drumsticks) by detecting contours.
4. Define **zones on the screen** where a hit triggers a specific keypress.
5. Use `pyautogui.press()` to simulate keypress events (e.g., mapped to drums in a DAW or online drum kit).
